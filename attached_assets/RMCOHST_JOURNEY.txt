Applicant Journey Map
Stage 1: Account Registration
The applicant navigates to the SmartAdmissions portal, completes the sign-up form with personal details, and verifies their email to activate their account. Mapping these initial touchpoints helps identify and eliminate barriers that prevent prospective students from entering the admissions funnel.
Stage 2: Application Fee Payment
Once registered, the applicant initiates a secure checkout to pay the non-refundable application fee and immediately receives a payment confirmation and digital receipt stored in Google Drive. Integrating payment gateways with cloud storage ensures full transparency and auditability in the admissions workflow.
Stage 3: Form Completion & Document Upload
The applicant completes a dynamic online form with conditional fields and uploads required documents (e.g., WAEC certificate, birth certificate) directly into the platform, which automatically organizes them into Google Drive folders. Real-time validation and file-type restrictions reduce errors and rework later in the process.
Stage 4: Application Submission & Confirmation
Upon clicking “Submit,” the system processes the application, updates the dashboard status to Submitted, and sends a confirmation email/SMS with a tracking link. Clear confirmation and immediate status updates reduce applicant anxiety and build trust in the platform.
Stage 5: Status Tracking & Notifications
The applicant monitors real-time status changes—such as Under Review, Decision Pending, or Decision Made—via their dashboard and receives push notifications on key updates. Automated notifications triggered by workflow events keep applicants engaged and eliminate the need for manual follow-up calls.
Stage 6: Decision Reception
When the Head of Admissions reaches a decision, the applicant receives an “Accepted” or “Rejected” notification with next-step instructions; accepted applicants see details for the acceptance fee payment. Prompt, clear decision communication—including precise action items—boosts conversion of accepted applicants into enrolled students.
Stage 7: Acceptance Fee Payment & Upgrade to Student
Accepted applicants pay the acceptance fee through the portal; upon successful payment, the system automatically upgrades their profile to Student status and creates a new student record. Automating this upgrade delivers a frictionless transition from applicant to student without administrative delays r.
Stage 8: Admission Letter Access & Download
The newly enrolled student downloads a personalized PDF admission letter generated on-demand and stored in their Google Drive folder for easy retrieval and archiving.
ADMISSION OFFICER USER JOURNEY
Stage 1: Secure Login & Dashboard Access
The Admissions Officer logs into the admin portal via secure authentication and lands on a personalized dashboard displaying assigned applications, workload metrics (e.g., average review time), and key performance indicators. Dashboards visualize task distribution and progress, reducing the need for manual tracking and boosting productivity.
Stage 2: Task List & Prioritization
The system presents a prioritized task list highlighting applications by urgency—based on submission date, completeness, and department quotas. Officers can filter and sort tasks by status (e.g., Submitted, Awaiting Documents), department, or payment confirmation to focus on high-priority reviews.
Stage 3: Document Verification
Clicking into an application, the officer opens the applicant’s structured Google Drive folder—automatically organized by document type (e.g., WAEC certificate, birth certificate, fee receipts)—for quick access. Real-time file previews and version history streamline validation, ensuring officers review the latest uploads without downloading files locally.
Stage 4: Application Assessment & Annotations
Officers examine form responses and supporting documents, adding internal comments or flagging items as complete or incomplete. The platform’s conditional logic scoring guides consistent evaluation against predefined criteria (e.g., minimum GPA, required certifications), reducing subjective discrepancies.
Stage 5: Communication & Document Requests
When additional information is needed, officers use the built-in messaging tool to request documents or clarifications; this action triggers automated email/SMS notifications to the applicant. Automated follow-up reminders are sent if requested items aren’t uploaded within a set timeframe, reducing review delays.
Stage 6: Status Updates & Audit Logging
After verification and preliminary assessment, officers update the application status to In Review, Awaiting Documents, or Ready for Decision, with all actions logged for audit and compliance. Detailed audit trails capture who made each change and when, supporting traceability and governance.
Stage 7: Handoff & Post-Decision Support
Completed reviews are forwarded to the Head of Admissions for final decision, preserving all annotations and audit logs. Once the Head’s decision is made, officers monitor acceptance-fee payments, verify receipts in Google Drive, and facilitate admission letter generation—ensuring students are upgraded seamlessly from applicant to enrolled status.
