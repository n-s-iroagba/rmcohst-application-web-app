// This file seems to be expected for Prisma, but you are using Sequelize.
// If you don't use Prisma, this file might not be needed, or the import should be removed.
// If it IS needed for some reason, and it's for Prisma:
// import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
// const prisma = new PrismaClient();
// export default prisma;

// If this file is NOT for Prisma and is an error, the import needs to be fixed elsewhere.
// For now, to satisfy the error if it's a misconfiguration:
const placeholderDb = {} // Placeholder
export default placeholderDb // To satisfy 'prisma as a default export' if it's a mistaken import
