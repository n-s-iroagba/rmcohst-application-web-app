// This service currently doesn't use driveService, but we'll include the import statement
// and a placeholder comment in case it's needed in the future.

// If this file (or any other service/controller) was using `driveService` imported from `../services/AdmissionLetterService`, update the import path.
// Since AdmissionLetterService might be moved, we'll assume it's now in a more general location.
// For example, if it's moved to a 'google' directory:
// import { driveService } from '../google/AdmissionLetterService';

// Or, if it's moved to a more general 'services' directory:
// import { driveService } from '../services/googleDriveService';

// For now, we'll leave it commented out and add a comment explaining why.

class ApplicantSSCQualificationService {
  // Placeholder for future functionality.
  // If driveService is needed, uncomment the import statement above and use it here.
  // Example:
  // async someMethod() {
  //   const file = await driveService.files.get({ fileId: 'someFileId' });
  //   return file;
  // }
}
